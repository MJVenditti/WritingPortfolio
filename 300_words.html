            <h3>On February</h3>  <!--Only use this section for "About me" text-->

            <p>My family and I do not celebrate the 
            Lunar New Year or comprehend every aspect of Black History Month. As a child, February always meant that my birthday was coming up. As isolated as this seems, 
            I am thankful that the people I was surrounded by most made this a routine.</p>
            
            <p>Fortunately, my family continues to ensure this month feels uniquely special. My elementary school broadcasts public announcements that highlight 
            Februaryâ€™s historical significance and societal impact. These announcements engage the most curious spaces of young minds with the hope that they consider 
            what February means to others. Throughout the years, I have become more educated on how I can effectively recognize Black History Month and understand what 
            the Lunar New Year means to those who observe. 
            I would consider this a more obscure form of self-care. It involves the admission of ignorance and knowing when to ask questions. I was given the 
            opportunity to review the contributions to this issue of the publication yet, I did not feel qualified to do so. February has been a very humbling 
            experience for me. I routinely connect with contributors to ensure that I preserve their message however it was more significant this month because 
            I needed to be taught.</p>
            
            <p>Self-care means more than eating pizza and playing video games on my birthday.
            This month, I wanted to further educate myself on the differences in cultures and families within Shopify. If you are the position I am, 
            have a conversation with your colleagues about what February means to them and I can assure you that this form of self-care will no longer be as obscure as it seems.
            <br>
            <br>With care,</br>
            Mike</p>
