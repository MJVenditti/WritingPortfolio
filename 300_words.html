            <p>February signals a time of recognition for those who are in a similar situation as my family and I. We are not familiar with the practices of celebrating the 
            Lunar New Year or with every contributing facet of Black History Month. As a child, February always meant that my birthday was coming up. The two groups I was
            surrounded by most, my family and my school, played a unique role in my life. <br><br>Fortunately, my family continues to ensure this month feels uniquely special
            whereas my elementary school broadcasted public announcements that concerned Februaryâ€™s historical significance and societal impact. These announcements
            engaged the most curious spaces of our young minds with the hope that we would consider what February meant to others. Throughout the years, I have
            become more educated on how I can effectively recognize Black History Month and understand what the Lunar New Year means to those who observe. 
            I would consider this a more obscure form of self-care. It involves the admission of ignorance and knowing when to ask questions. I was given the 
            opportunity to review the contributions of our authors prior to the publication of this issue yet, I did not feel qualified to do so. This month 
            has been a very humbling experience for me. I routinely connect with our contributors to ensure that I preserve their intended message but I felt 
            it was more significant this month because I needed to be taught. Self-care means more than eating pizza and playing video games on my birthday.
            This month, I wanted to further educate myself on the differences in cultures and families within Shopify. If you are in a position like myself, 
            have a conversation with your colleagues about what February means to them and I can assure you that this form of self-care will no longer be as obscure as it seems. <br>
            <br>With care,<br>
            Mike</p>
