            <h3>On Self-Care</h3>

            <p>My family and I do not celebrate the 
            Lunar New Year or comprehend every aspect of Black History Month. As a child, February always meant that my birthday was coming up. As isolated as this seems, 
            I am thankful that the people I was surrounded by most made this a routine.</p>
            
            <p>Fortunately, my family continues to ensure this month feels uniquely special. My elementary school broadcasts public announcements that highlight 
            February’s historical significance and societal impact. These announcements engage the most curious spaces of young minds with the hope that they consider 
            what February means to others. Throughout the years, I have become more educated on how I can effectively recognize Black History Month and understand what 
            the Lunar New Year means to those who observe. 
            I would consider this a more obscure form of self-care. It involves the admission of ignorance and knowing when to ask questions. I was given the 
            opportunity to review the contributions to this issue of the publication yet, I did not feel qualified to do so. February has been a very humbling 
            experience for me. I routinely connect with contributors to ensure that I preserve their message however it was more significant this month because 
            I needed to be taught.</p>
            
            <p>Self-care means more than eating pizza and playing video games on my birthday.
            This month, I wanted to further educate myself on the differences in cultures and families within Shopify. If you are the position I am, 
            have a conversation with your colleagues about what February means to them and I can assure you that this form of self-care will no longer be as obscure as it seems.

            <h3>On Spring Cleaning</h3>  <!--Only use this section for "About me" text-->

            <p>We can all tell that a hint of Spring is now in the air! I have always been a firm believer of Spring Cleaning. 
            I recently opened the door of my office, as many of us are fortunate enough to do, and visualized the potential within from decor to professional goals. 
            The office is an all-encompassing space where we spend most of our time so we should feel productive and comfortable whenever we commit to our professional development.</p>


            <p>Spring cleaning also presents an opportunity to evaluate the progress we’ve made on our goals for the year. 
            If it so happens that we aren’t where we thought we would be, rest assured that no one is alone! Now is the perfect time to be inspired by those around us. 
            I’ve always looked to my grandmother for a source of inspiration as she established a life in Canada and set the roots of my family’s recent history when she was only eighteen. 
            Whether it’s celebrating a family member, sharing a laugh with friends, or enjoying the space around you, it’s important to find a reason for happiness this March.</p>

            <h3>On Sustainability and Caring</h3>  <!--Only use this section for "About me" text-->

            <p>In contrast to the recent winter months, I have had the amazing opportunity to begin my days outside or with the windows open to start appreciating the environment that I work in. Starting the day this way is said to focus us in ways that several cups of coffee can’t. 
                Even going for a short hike recontextualizes Earth Day as we consider what this moment in time means for us and our health. I have been shown time and time again the importance of taking a moment to pause and be mindful of the space around us. My partner has done this more than anyone I know. 
                This contributes to her uncompromised love for the planet that we live on demonstrated by encouraging me to participate in outdoor activities, finding us a dog that coaxes us outside four times per day, and providing healthy plant-based options for us. Most importantly, I understand she cares.</p>
            
                <p>We can use this mindset to present more environmentally-friendly options for merchants surrounding Earth Day. Could they benefit from using Shop Pay and contribute to Shopify’s carbon offsetting initiative or perhaps a Capital funding opportunity will allow them to purchase recycled packaging? 
                Regardless, showing merchants that we care will in turn, ask them to care. If they are already on board with an environmental action plan, we now play a role in aligning the goals of Shopify with theirs.</p>
                
                
                <p>Speaking to a human being is one of the many benefits contacting Shopify support provides. Each one of us needs to call Earth home, and if no other alignment opportunities present themselves during conversation, this is a common ground that we can all accept. 
                Showing merchants we care, just like they do, is another step towards making commerce better for everyone.</p>

            <h3>On Setting Goals</h3>  <!--Only use this section for "About me" text-->

            <p>How are we feeling about our current position within the Shopify ecosystem? Have we taken the time to reflect on what’s next in our career? With so many opportunities available to Support at Shopify, our goals are always worth considering.     
            Next month will conclude my first year at Shopify as a support advisor. It is without a doubt the most difficult and engaging position I have had the opportunity to work in. This job is not easy. Being part of support as a whole is not easy no matter 
            where you are. I commend every one of you who continue to work so diligently for the merchants who rely on Shopify every day.</p>


            <p>Whether we have been with Shopify for a week or a year, it is likely that we have been exposed to other roles and opportunities that interest us. As members of support, we have the unique 
            opportunity to interact with many branches of Shopify’s operations and if one area has caught your interest, reach out! 
            Shopify is supportive and enthusiastic. I am so thankful to have spoken with so many different people who allow Shopify to operate in the ways that it does. 
            Using Slack, we have the tools to communicate with whoever we wish directly. Slack grants us the opportunity to even create communities of our own!</p>
            <p>Personally, I have had the pleasure to participate in music and tech channels that connect me with Shopifolk in a new way. 
            This month, let’s establish what we know is right for us and ask, how can I achieve this within my team or within Shopify? Showing initiative and communicating with people 
            demonstrates our intention to further impact those around us and from what I can tell, this is exactly what Shopify needs.</p>

            <h3>On Love</h3>  <!--Only use this section for "About me" text-->

            <p>Love should always be on our minds. That is Love with a capital L to include the many different branches of our relationships. This month, we focus on loving the people, 
            places, and things that surround us, and also recognizing what we can do to show our appreciation for them.</p>
            <p>You don’t have to love everything. I’d be quite surprised if that was the case! What’s important is to recognize what we love, 
            and do everything we can to show that we care. June is host to World Environment Day and this is another opportunity to act on love for our home. 
            This is not just our home but the home of every creature that we love, every scenic view we remember, and the future we want. When we all recognize the love for our home, 
            we can make a surprising amount of difference with every action.</p>
            <p>Just like loving our home, we need to feel free to express the love of those around us. No one should feel restricted in who they should love. Communities all over 
            the world need love more than anything else and people should know that we are there for them. There are many who report simple actions like listening to how they feel can make a huge difference. 
            If there is someone in our life who needs to be heard, please reach out to them and let them know they are loved. Everyone and everything deserves to know that there is support 
            and a helping hand waiting to be called on. Love makes all the difference we need.</p>
